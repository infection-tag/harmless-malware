# How to execute:

## Using already-existing executables

Download the executables that are in the default directory of this repository.

Open your terminal. Navigate to the folder you have downloaded the executables to. From there, run the following command:

```
./(filenamehere)
```

where (filenamehere) is the name of the executable. So, for instance, if I wanted to run `crash`, I would navigate to the directory with the downloaded executables, and type in the following:

```
./crash
```

## Using the source code

Download the src/ file in this repository. Open up the directory in Terminal. From there, type:

```
g++
```

If you get a popup asking you to download g++ or gcc, say yes. (No, this isn't malware; it's just the compiler for C++, the language the malware is written in. It won't harm your computer.) After g++ has installed, type it into your terminal again.    
If you don't get a popup, but instead get this message:
```
clang: error: no input files
```
You are all set. Now all you need to do is type  
```
g++ (sourcefilenamehere)
```
where (sourcefilenamehere) is the name of the source code file included in the src/ file you downloaded. So, for example, if I wanted to run the executable for `crash.cpp`, I would type
```
g++ crash.cpp
```
to create my executable. Once your executable is created, type
```
./a.out
```
to run your malware.
